Assignment 1: Create an infographic illustrating the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. Highlight steps like writing tests before code, benefits such as bug reduction, and how it fosters software reliability.

TDD:- test driven development.
1.	Write a test
2.	Write a code
3.	Refactor the code
Benefits:- 
	Ensure code quality
	Simplifies code debugging
	Encourages simple designs
Suitability:- 
•	High reliability
•	Complex logic
•	Frequent refactoring
BDD:- behaviour driven development
1.	Define behaviour in plain language
2.	Write tests based on behaviour
3.	Develop code to pass the tests
Benefits:-
	Enhaces collaboration
	Clear sepcifications
	Ensures it reaches client and bussines needs
Suitability:- 
•	Project focus on user experience
•	Need clear communication
•	Frequent client interaction
FDD:- feature driven development
1.	Develop total model
2.	Build feature list
3.	Plan feature ist
4.	Design by feature
5.	Build by feature
Benefits:- 
	focus on delivering value
	improved project tracking
	scalable for large projects.
Suitability:- 
•	large scale projects.
•	Project needs frequent releases
•	Teams with mixed expertise


	
TTD:-                                	    write test

                                             Write code to pass test cases   -------pass-----create new tests again
                                                   | 
                                            Not passed refactor
                                                   |
                                              Repeat

BDD:-                                   
                                              Explain behaviour in plain language
                                                        | 
                                               Create test based on defined behaviour 
                                                        |
                                                Develop code to pass the tests
                                                        | 
                                                    Run al the tests
                                                        |
                                                      Repeat


FDD:-   
							     Develop overall model
                                                                         |
                                                              Build a feature list
                                                                         |
                                                                 Plan by feature
                                                                         |
                                                                Design by feature
                                                                         | 
                                                                   Build by feature
