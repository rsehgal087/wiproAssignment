Assignment 3: Research and compare SDLC models suitable for engineering projects. Present findings on Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model approaches, emphasizing their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability in different engineering contexts.

SDLC Models for Engineering Projects
Choosing the right SDLC model is crucial for the success of any engineering project. Here's a comparison of four popular models: Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different engineering contexts.

1. Waterfall Model:

Description: A sequential, linear approach. Each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed in order before moving to the next.

Advantages:
Clear roadmap and well-defined deliverables at each stage.
Easier project management and resource allocation due to upfront planning.
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal change expectations.

Disadvantages:
Inflexible and poorly suited for projects with evolving requirements.
Limited user feedback until later stages, potentially leading to rework.
High risk of late-stage defects if requirements are not carefully defined initially.

Applicability:  Suitable for projects with stable requirements, such as infrastructure development, traditional embedded systems, or well-defined software updates.

2. Agile Model:

Description: An iterative and incremental approach. Project progresses in short sprints (development cycles) with continuous feedback and adaptation.

Advantages:
Highly adaptable to changing requirements due to iterative development.
Early and frequent user feedback leads to a product that better meets user needs.
Faster time-to-market through iterative delivery of working features.

Disadvantages:
Requires a strong commitment to collaboration and communication.
May not be ideal for projects with strict deadlines or fixed requirements.
Can lead to scope creep if not carefully managed.

Applicability:  Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, rapid prototyping needs, or user-facing applications like web or mobile development. It's also well-suited for projects where new technologies are being explored.

3. Spiral Model:

Description: Combines elements of Waterfall and Agile. Iterative development cycles with risk management strategies incorporated at each stage.

Advantages:
Provides a structured approach for managing risk and mitigating project failures.
Allows for iterative development while maintaining a focus on project planning and risk mitigation.
Suitable for complex projects with evolving requirements and high-risk factors.

Disadvantages:
Can be complex to manage due to its iterative and risk-driven nature.
Requires strong project leadership and risk management expertise.
Might not be the most efficient approach for smaller projects.

Applicability:  Ideal for large-scale, complex projects with high risk factors, such as developing new medical devices, critical infrastructure systems, or aerospace projects.

4. V-Model:

Description: A synchronized model where testing activities (verification and validation) occur alongside corresponding development phases in a V-shaped pattern.

Advantages:
Strong emphasis on early and comprehensive testing throughout the development lifecycle.
Helps identify and address defects early, reducing rework and costs.
Well-suited for projects where rigorous quality assurance is critical.

Disadvantages:
Similar to Waterfall, it's less adaptable to changing requirements.
Requires significant investment in testing resources and expertise.
May not be necessary for all engineering projects.

Applicability:  Ideal for projects with strict safety and regulatory requirements, such as medical device development, safety-critical software systems, or nuclear power plant control systems.
